~~~Nomenclature~~~

-Touchpads
	-Pad1: scroll value of	-4	//cooresponds to Line1
	-Pad2: scroll value of 	-2	//Line2
	-Pad3: scroll value of 	0	//Line3
	-Pad4: scroll value of 	2	//Line4
	-Pad5: scroll value of 	4	//Line5

-"Base 2" means 2^x, where x is the ScrollRate



~~~ISR~~~

*globals
	-NetRate
	-Enumerated types for "increment" and "decrement"

*when any Pad is pressed

	-Set TotalScroll value and the line count to 0
	-Go through all captouch lines
		-is the Line high?
			-yes
				-add the scroll value to the total
				-increment line count			//this will keep track of how many pads are pressed
			-no
				-go to next Line
	
	-is the value of TotalScroll negative?
		-yes
			-set scroll mode to "decrement"
			-multiply TotalScroll by negative 1, 		//to match the lookuptable later for Final scroll rate
		-no
			-set scroll mode to "increment"
	-is the line count greater than 1?
		-yes
			-divide TotalScroll by 2
	-enter a lookup table that will determine the NetRate of the system as follows
		-NetRate is a base 2 exponential with the exception of input 0, which outputs 0 as well

	~	~TotalScroll~	~NetRate~
	~
	~	0		0
	~	1		2
	~	2		4
	~	3		8
	~	4		16

	-Turn on timer
-leave




*when timerScroll procs

*static counter = 0
	
	-increment the counter by 1
	-is the counter greater than 256?
		-yes
			-set counter = 1

	-is the counter % NetRate == 0?
		-yes
			-is the scroll mode set to "decrement"?
				-yes
					-decrease output by 1
				-no
					-increase output by 1
			-printf
		-no
-leave
